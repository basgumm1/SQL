**Retrieve from the trips table all the rides that started in the Loop (pickup_location_id: 50) on a Saturday and ended at O'Hare (dropoff_location_id: 63). Get the weather conditions for each ride. Use the method you applied in the previous task. Also, retrieve the duration of each ride. Ignore rides for which data on weather conditions is not available.

The table columns should be in the following order:

start_ts
weather_conditions
duration_seconds
Sort by trip_id.**


SELECT
    start_ts,
    T.weather_conditions,
    duration_seconds
FROM 
    trips
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT
        ts,
        CASE
            WHEN description LIKE '%rain%' OR description LIKE '%storm%' THEN 'Bad'
            ELSE 'Good'
        END AS weather_conditions
    FROM 
        weather_records          
) T ON T.ts = trips.start_ts
